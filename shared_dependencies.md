The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **CSS Modules**: CSS Modules are used in the .css files for styling the components. The class names defined in these files are used in the .tsx files.

5. **Document**: This is a custom document file used by Next.js for server-side rendering. It is used in the _document.tsx file.

6. **App**: This is a custom app component used by Next.js for initializing pages. It is used in the _app.tsx file.

7. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts, which are shared across the project.

8. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the TypeScript configuration options which are shared across all TypeScript files in the project.

9. **DOM Elements**: The id names of DOM elements that JavaScript functions will use are shared across the .tsx files. These could include elements like buttons, inputs, divs, etc.

10. **Function Names**: Any functions that are exported from one file and used in another would be a shared dependency. These could include utility functions, API calls, context providers, etc.

11. **Data Schemas**: If there are any data schemas defined (for example, for validating API responses or form inputs), these would be shared across any files that use them.
