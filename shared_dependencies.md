The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application files.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the `.tsx` files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts. It is referenced by all other files that require external modules.

5. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for the TypeScript compiler. It is referenced by all `.tsx` files.

6. **_app.tsx**: This file is a custom App component. It initializes pages and can be used to keep state between pages. It is referenced by all other pages in the application.

7. **_document.tsx**: This file is a custom Document component. It is used to augment the application's `<html>` and `<body>` tags. It is referenced by all other pages in the application.

8. **globals.css**: This file contains global styles that are applied to the entire application. It is referenced by all other pages in the application.

9. **favicon.ico**: This file is the website's favicon. It is referenced by the `_document.tsx` file.

10. **.gitignore**: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It doesn't directly share dependencies with other files, but it's crucial for the version control system.

11. **README.md**: This file contains information about the project. It doesn't directly share dependencies with other files, but it's important for documentation.

Please note that specific exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names would depend on the specific implementation of the application and are not included in this general overview.
